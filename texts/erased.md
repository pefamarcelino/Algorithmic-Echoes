# Erased

Mom entered through the living room door with tears in her eyes, sat beside us, and said that grandma had passed away.
At the wake, I didn't recognize my grandmother in the casket. It seemed like they had replaced her with a wax figure.
One of my aunts, seeing me cry, came over and said, "The important thing is for you to remember her."
I was scared because my memory was terrible.

After the funeral, my dad took me to a toy store and bought my first video game.
The equipment in question had only one cartridge, which you plugged into a slot.
The screen lit up with colors, and a gray cat appeared, dancing.
Then you jumped, rolled, scratched until you completed the levels.
I could never finish them all: *I had no memory*.
There *wasn't yet* a *device* where you could *save progress*.

Much later, in the future, I found a file containing memories from that time.
I recognized everything: the streets, the cats, The Ball House, looping plots, algorithms constructing realities... Everything. I recognized everything!
So I did what needed to be done: I trained an artificial intelligence to analyze and reconstruct those files.
At first, it was a relief, but then it became boring. When it was over, I asked it to hide them in a black hole on the Internet, hoping they would never be found.

But the stories gained "life."
The bytes rebelled and spread through the digital universe like a virus.
The world is going to be erased.
Everything will disappear.
