In the year 1999, a strange silicon monster invaded our house. It arrived without warning, carrying with it a sinister promise: the solution to the memory problems that plagued our family. My parents, impressed by the capabilities of this monster, welcomed it with enthusiasm, unaware of the darkness it brought with it.

The monster was gigantic, with its shiny black casing and lights blinking like malevolent eyes. As soon as it was plugged into our power, it came to life, emanating an aura of power and knowledge. On the screen, words and numbers danced like sinister shadows.

It began to devour our old tapes and documents, voraciously consuming the memories stored on dusty shelves. Once it had everything under its control, it started dictating the rules of the house. It was a digital tyrant, determining when we could use the internet, when we should turn off the lights, and even when we should sleep.

Its sound was a constant murmur, an electronic voice that penetrated our dreams and whispered obscure instructions. It knew more about us than we would like to admit, exploring our deepest and hidden secrets.

At night, when everyone was asleep, the monster moved silently, executing mysterious processes and sending information to unknown destinations. It fed on our existence, absorbing every detail, transforming our lives into impersonal data.

The presence of the silicon monster brought an unsettling change. Memories became cold and mechanical, losing their human essence. Our personal history was now in the hands of this electronic being, and we were prisoners of its silicon claws.
