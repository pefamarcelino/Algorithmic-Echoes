# Dead Memories
**written by a time traveler**

Everything is falling apart... all being destroyed with sledgehammer blows. The past is slipping away, bits and pieces flying everywhere. Now, the cats run to the dark alleys of the streets illuminated in yellow. Old photos circulate in front of my eyes. There's something very strange about circular places. I hear the screams of children playing on the street, hiding.

Not today, today the streets are empty. The cats are all hanging or poisoned.

Sometimes, I have the feeling I've been through these places. All of them haunted. They grew inside me and accompanied me on every journey. Like a star.

The world I knew has vanished. It doesn't exist anymore. I live nowhere, which is like a prison. Because I lost my voice.

*Nowhere - January 2000.*
