# Say Hi, Uncle Johnny
**author: Eletronic Doll**

Uncle Johnny was a hundred and twenty-four years old when he passed away. His face still resembled that of a boy. Uncle Johnny suffered a stroke that left him wheelchair-bound. Every morning, Mom and I would push Uncle Johnny out to soak up the sun. He would always complain but loved to tell stories.

One night he was very ill, coughing incessantly. Mom and I went to visit him. "Take care of your uncle; I'll be right back." When she returned, she had brought the family doctor.

Dr. Fat Fingers opened Uncle Johnny's throat with a massive metal clamp. Finally, he said, "We'll need to clean everything!" After three days in the hospital, Uncle Johnny was finally discharged.

Mom took me to see him. There was a piece of metal in the middle of his throat. To converse, you had to stick a microphone into the hole. Then Mom said, "Say hi, Uncle Johnny." His voice came out metallic like a robot.

When he passed away, he had fully embraced the body of a robot. All his limbs had been replaced by metal parts, even his way of speaking and telling stories. Now, Uncle Johnny spoke in the language of machines.

"Say hi, Uncle Johnny."
