# The Ball House Story
**author: unknown**

When I was eight years old, the children in my neighborhood used to play on the street until late. As night fell, they would tell horror stories. Among them, the tale of a haunted house at the end of the neighborhood. The house, they said, had caught fire, claiming the lives of the entire family: the father, the mother, the eldest son, and the youngest daughter.
"Ball House," their voices whispered, "Because it's all made in circles, haven't you heard?"
Sometimes you can hear the screams of the tormented souls and see shadows passing through the corridors.

One day, I was at a friend's house when she showed me a newspaper clipping, hidden by her grandmother, about the fire at the Ball House.
I used to think the stories told by the kids were lies, but after seeing that, I began to doubt. How much of it was true? Was the house really haunted?

One night, while eating a hot dog at a street stall, the children appeared and called me to go with them to the abandoned house.
Finally, the chance had come. I would finally know what it was like, learn the truth, and then become one of the kids to tell "the Ball House story."

I remember going down a street illuminated by the yellowish light of the lampposts. At the end of this street, we had arrived.
"Where is the house?" I asked, unable to see anything.
One of the kids tapped on my shoulder, and I turned around: the house was there behind me, now facing me.
I was impressed for a moment, but then my expectations dropped: the house was in complete ruins. The remaining bricks were all burned due to the fire.
A huge thicket swallowed the house.

When I got home, my mother asked me where I had been. I told her about the house.
"You are forbidden to go there!" she said.

The next day, I had completely forgotten about the Ball House and was playing alone on the street when one of the kids approached.
"I need to talk to you," her voice trembled.
"What is it?" I asked, frightened.
"You..." she said slowly, the words almost not coming out, "... You are cursed!"
"It's a lie!" I retorted, shouting.

I woke up the next day feeling strange. I no longer knew what was true and what wasn't.
I shouldn't have heard about the Ball House and gone to see it.
I regret it, and that's why I still live there today.
