# Mr. AssTalk
**A stand-up and comedy show created in 1997 by a young waiter named Walter Appletoxy**

**Mr. AssTalk:**

*(Raising his eyebrows to the audience)* - Heard the mayor of this town is so old he still writes by hand.
The audience laughs along with the puppet.

**Mr. AssTalk:**

*(with a disturbing smile)* - Maybe that's why the bills are all messed up! Ha Ha Ha
The audience bursts into laughter.

**Mr. AssTalk:**

If only I were friends with the mayor! Ha Ha Ha
The audience goes wild.

**Mr. AssTalk:**

*(philosophical)* - Seriously though, want to hear a story? It's about damn copyrights. I hate copyrights!
At that moment, the audience fell silent. No one expected that from Mr. AssTalk. The puppet then took out a paper from the black background.

**Mr. AssTalk:**

Look, slandered again by this rotten press! They say I'm an outlaw, a troublemaker. That I'm just a puppet and therefore can't tell stories! These damn amoebas!!! Once again, they're suppressing me, these poor hypocrites! Goodbye, you bunch of clowns!
Mr. AssTalk then closes his eyes, and a beep counts to three. 1... 2... 3... *BOOM!*
