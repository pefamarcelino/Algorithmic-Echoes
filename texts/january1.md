**Diary Entry - January 1**

It’s another day wrestling with the cursed blank page. The literary demons whispering doubt in my ear, reminding me how publishers feed off the souls of struggling writers. It's a dance with despair, yet here I am, ready to tango once more.

For years, I've harbored a dream, a recurring vision that dances on the edges of my subconscious – a dream set in a place known only as The End of the World. In this surreal realm, the people who have woven the fabric of my life gather for a celebration, a cosmic jubilation that defies the mundane boundaries of reality.

The allure of translating this dream into a tangible tale has haunted me like a phantom limb. Publishers, however, demand more than whimsical dreams; they crave marketable stories with predictable arcs. My dream, with its ethereal landscapes and ephemeral joy, doesn’t fit neatly into their molds.

Yet, despite the relentless rejection, I hold on to the belief that one day, I'll uncover a technique capable of transcribing the vivid memories of my childhood onto the page. Until then, I remain tethered to this desk, wrestling with words and waiting for the elusive muse to whisper the secrets.
